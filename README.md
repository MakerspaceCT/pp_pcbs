# Painless Prototyping BYO PCB Kit

## Intro

If you're reading this, you probably picked up a BYO Keyboard kit from MakerspaceCT. These boards were designed by [Painless Prototyping](https://painlessprototyping.com/) to use the Itsy Bitsy M0 Express. In order to keep costs down, we've packaged the boards with Pro Micro microcontrollers powered by the Atmega32u4. The functionality is the same, but it requires aligning the pins correctly.

## Contents
The kit includes the following:
* PCB
* Pro Micro clone
* Gateron PCB-mount Switches (Red) (6x)
* Diodes (THT) (6x)
